# NSF RESET Workshop: Introduction to Public Health Data Science using the R Programming Language
## March 06, 2021

This workshop will employ computational data science techniques covering the first 4 main steps of a typical data science pipeline: 
1. Acquisition 
2. Tidying/Manipulation 
3. Trasnformation 
4. Visualization/Communication 

Attendees will be presented with healthcare data apply the taught methodologies to solve a representative problem. This workshop will use the R programming language with a major emphasis on the libraries within the Tidyverse. A keen understanding of functional programming languages and/or R is recommended but not required. The goal of the workshop is to give attendees the opportunity to deploy a near complete data science pipeline. 

What you will need:  

* Presentation: `slides.pdf`
* Code: `import_tidy_transform_viz.Rmd`
* R & RStudio 
  * PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THIS SETUP
    * It would be ideal to follow along locally, on your own machine
    * Here is a [TUTORIAL FOR WINDOWS](https://derailment.netlify.app/2019-12-10-installing-r-rstudio-on-windows/) & [TUTORIAL FOR MAC](https://derailment.netlify.app/2019-11-16-installing-r-rstudio-on-a-mac/) that can help you get up and running :)
  * If you do not have R & RStudio set up on your machine by the time the workshop rolls around, no fear - cloud is here! 🦸‍♀
